```

### /:id

- Get Book
  **get** => will recieve a response as the book as an object

- Update one/many Fields In A Book
  **put** => please refer to user/:id put as it works mostly the same way. If updating an array with the request =>

```
{
	"isbn": "this item"
}
```

This will change the _whole array_ to be one item, the outcome will be =>

```
{
  "isnb" : ["this item"]
}
```

- Delete Book
  **del** => The reponse will be the book as an object.

### /user

- Add Interested User To Book
  **post** => This will happen on swiping to add an interested user. The expected request is the user id and book id =>

```
{
	"userId": "mongoose id",
	"bookId": "mongoose id"
}
```

The reponse will be the book as an object. _currently in the process of making a middleware that can stop the duplication of interested user, however right now you can add the same user to a book multiple times_
